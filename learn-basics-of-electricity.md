# Basics of Electricity

Electricity is the foundation of all modern electronics. Before diving into circuits and components, it's important to understand the basic concepts that govern how electricity works.

## What Is Electricity?

Electricity is the flow of electric charge, typically carried by electrons in a conductor like copper wire. This flow is what powers everything from light bulbs to smartphones.

There are two main types of electricity:
- **Static electricity**: a buildup of charge on the surface of an object.
- **Current electricity**: a continuous flow of charge, which is what we use in electronic circuits.

## Key Concepts

### Voltage (V)
Voltage is the **potential difference** between two points. Think of it like pressure in a water pipe—it pushes electrons through a circuit. It’s measured in **volts (V)**.

### Current (I)
Current is the **rate of flow** of electric charge. It’s like the amount of water flowing through a pipe. Measured in **amperes (A)**, current tells us how many electrons are moving.

### Resistance (R)
Resistance is the **opposition** to the flow of current. Materials like rubber have high resistance, while metals like copper have low resistance. It’s measured in **ohms (Ω)**.

## Ohm’s Law

One of the most important relationships in electronics is **Ohm’s Law**:
