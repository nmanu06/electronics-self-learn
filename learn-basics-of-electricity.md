## What Is Electricity?

Electricity is the foundation of all modern electronics. Before diving into circuits and components, it's important to understand the basic concepts that govern how electricity works.

Electricity is the flow of electric charge, typically carried by electrons in a conductor like copper wire. This flow is what powers everything from light bulbs to smartphones.

There are two main types of electricity:
- **Static electricity**: a buildup of charge on the surface of an object.
- **Current electricity**: a continuous flow of charge, which is what we use in electronic circuits.

## Key Concepts

### Voltage (V)
Voltage is the **potential difference** between two points. Think of it like pressure in a water pipe—it pushes electrons through a circuit. It’s measured in **volts (V)**.

### Current (I)
Current is the **rate of flow** of electric charge. It’s like the amount of water flowing through a pipe. Measured in **amperes (A)**, current tells us how many electrons are moving.

### Resistance (R)
Resistance is the **opposition** to the flow of current. Materials like rubber have high resistance, while metals like copper have low resistance. It’s measured in **ohms (Ω)**.

## Ohm’s Law

One of the most important relationships in electronics is **Ohm’s Law**:

V = I × R

This means voltage equals current times resistance. If you know any two of these values, you can calculate the third.

## Why It Matters

Understanding these basics is essential for building and troubleshooting circuits. Whether you're lighting an LED or designing a robot, these principles are always at work.
